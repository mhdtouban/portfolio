Handling lifecycle events, maintaining view state, and persisting data are all common challenges on Android that have contributed to the widespread adoption of clean architecture patterns like Model-View-Presenter (MVP) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).

Android Architecture Components is a new collection of libraries announced at Google I/O to help developers manage these same nagging issues. This talk explores how Architecture Components can be leveraged in an app already using clean architecture principles to help make your code even more flexible, maintainable, and testable.
This talk was presented at [GDG Coast Lebanon](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coast-Lebanon/events/250065254/).
