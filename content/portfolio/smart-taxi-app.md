This was the first application I built as a freelance developer rather than with
Gridstone. As an external contractor I in no way condone the actions of the client.
I'm proud of the app's implementation and design, and would like to discuss it in
isolation from the scandal.

Android apps are often considered as an afterthought to their iOS counterparts. With
The Whole Pantry, Alex Benevento led the charge as the iOS developer with
[Zane David](https://dribbble.com/zane_david) providing him with dedicated designs.
For Android, it was up to me to come up with analogous screens that would feel at
home.

I was chuffed to have the app win a place in Google's [Beautiful Design Winter 2013](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3000235_beautiful_apps) collection.
