Built at [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), Duress Alarm aims to be a simple
and subtle way for workers out in the field to request help. The Android app
does this by presenting a persistent *HELP* button that's available at all times;
even on the user's lock screen. This allows users to request assistance without
making their actions apparent to a potential assailant. When the user triggers
the alarm their current location gets sent out to all people who have been set up
as emergency contacts.

This app was the first commercial app ever released by Gridstone that's written
entirely in Kotlin.

The app can be found in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.gridstone.duress),
however to function the app requires a licence that's issued from Telstra.
