At [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), this app was built for a client
that specialises in road traffic control and safety. They work with large
numbers of contractors with varying availabilities, and needed something
to assist with the difficulties they had scheduling work days.

The Android app allowed contractors to mark their availablities, letting admin
know exactly what days they were able to work. Jobs were then sent out as push
notifications that contractors could accept or reject, letting admin quickly
work out if they had a complete roster for a shift.

Unfortunately the app never saw the light of day for use in production, but I
was happy with the design and all Kotlin implementation.
