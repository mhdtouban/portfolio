Built at [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au) for the Victorian Department of
Health and Human Services, VaxOnTime is an app that helps remind parents when
immunisations are due for their children. It also provides the ability to search
for nearby facilities that provide vaccinations with their booking information.

Only iOS designs were ever formally created for this project, and it was up to me
to invent something that would feel at home on Android.

This was the last app I ever built using Java before migrating to Kotlin. It
leans heavily on Square's libraries [Flow](https://github.com/square/flow) and
[Mortar](https://github.com/square/mortar) in order to deal with navigation and
dependency injection.

The app can be found in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.vic.dhhs.vaxontime).
