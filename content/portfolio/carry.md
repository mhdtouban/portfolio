Built at [Ideatolife](https://ideatolife.me) for an on-demand delivery startup based out of Dubai, UAE. [Carry](https://carry.delivery/ae/en/) is driven via an app that customers can download to their smartphones for both Android and iOS.

You simply pin the location and destination of your package, provide some info on its size and how fragile it is, schedule when you would like the delivery to occur and a driver will be dispatched within the hour.

The best part is that your package won’t be sent on a tour of the city before reaching its final destination as is sometimes the case with other similar delivery services. You’re even able to track the delivery in real time via the app.

The app can be found in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=carry.client.carry.ae).
