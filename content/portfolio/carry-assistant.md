At [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), I built the Alert SA Android app as part
of a suite of applications for the South Australian Government. My colleagues also
developed a [website](https://www.alert.sa.gov.au) and an
[iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alert-sa/id998243397?ls=1&mt=8). The
service aims to deliver information and warnings to those living in South Australia,
allowing users to browse nearby events and set up watch zones.

This app was the first I designed and developed with Google's
[material design](https://design.google.com/) spec in mind. It also allowed me to
make use of the very latest libraries and tools, and serves as a fine example of a
modern Android Application.

Unfortunately this application is no longer maintained by Gridstone, and development
effort has since shifted to another company. The app can still be found in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.alert.sa),
however the design and implementation has been replaced wholesale.
