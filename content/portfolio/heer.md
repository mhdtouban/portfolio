Emergency AUS was the first application I developed at
[Gridstone](//gridstone.com.au/). Version 2.0 of the application (as seen in the
screenshots) was also my first opportunity to contribute to the design of a project.

The app was built as a joint collaboration between Gridstone and
[Ripe Intelligence](https://ripeintel.info/) to deliver real time information and
alerts to people around Australia. It was a massive undertaking considering the
experience I had at the time, and forced me to learn the ins and outs of Android
development.

These days the app is looking a little dated with its
[Holo era](http://android-developers.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/holo-everywhere.html)
design, but it still functions just fine. Check it out in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gridstone.emergencyaus).
