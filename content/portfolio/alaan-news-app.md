Together with five other students at Swinburne University we built an Android game
from the ground up called Tasty Fish. It was an ambitious final-year project, as we
eschewed any pre-existing game engines and built one ourselves using
[LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

We built the game as part of a subject aimed to give us an idea of what development
was like in industry. Our group was allocated a company called Naturally Being (which
would later become [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au/)) who we had to develop the
game for as if they were a real client.

This was an enormous learning experience, granting perspectives on managing client
expectations and deadlines. It was also the first time many of us had managed a
codebase at a high level of complexity, and we all learnt how difficult it can be to
coordinate so many developers in a single team.
