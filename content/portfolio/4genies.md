Built at [Aiia-Solutions](http://www.aiia-solutions.com/). 4Genies is neutral and independent self-care app for mobile subscriber in the GCC countries. 4Genies revolutionized the recharge process for prepaid customers by allowing them to seamlessly recharge a voucher by taking a picture and automatically recognize the numbers and perform the recharge command for each operator.

4Genies allows user to better control their telecom budget by providing detailed charts of their telecom usage on both calls and data usage with a daily, weekly and monthly view.

The digitalization of the voucher picture was developed internally by AiiA solutions using TensorFlow.
The app can be found in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aiia.cardreader).
