At [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au) we built this app as a prototype for
Australian Wool Holdings. It aims to help their warehouse workers keep track
of what tasks they're working on and how long they spend on each one.

Written entirely in Kotlin, this app had some fun illustrations and
animations that kept it from feeling too corporate.
