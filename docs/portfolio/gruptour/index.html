      <h2>Gruptour</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>Built at <a href="https://ideatolife.me">Ideatolife</a> for a startup based out of Beirut, Lebanon. <a href="http://gruptour.com/">Gruptour</a> is a platform that help small group organizers to manage the trip, to share the itinerary with their customers, solicit customer feedback, and much more.. I have built both the backend (using PHP laravel) and the mobile app.</p>

<p>Founded in December 2015, GrupTrip S.A.L. is a young tech company on a mission to provide the best smartphone experience for travelers. GrupTrip’s technology is focused on the organization of group travel. The company’s first offering and flagship was the GrupTrip App that helps friends, family, and colleagues to keep their trip organized and fun. The GrupTrip App is available in App Store and Google Play. The second offering is the GrupTour Platform that is for travelers that would like to experience trips/tours organized by others. The platform consists of the GrupTour “My Tour App”, GrupTour Manager Console, and GrupTour Booking. With the GrupTour Platform, tour organizers can now offer a better customer experience and streamline their sign-up process while collecting valuable data about their tours.
