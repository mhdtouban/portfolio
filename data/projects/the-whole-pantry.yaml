description: This was the first application I built a freelance developer rather than with Gridstone. Much controversy surrounds this app and the client it was developed for, and I'm not going to go into that here. I built this application as an external contractor, and I feel it stands alone as something well built and well designed.<br/><br/>Android apps are often considered as an afterthought to their iOS counterparts. With The Whole Pantry, Alex Benevento led the charge as the iOS developer with [Zane David](https://dribbble.com/zane_david) providing him with dedicated designs. For Android, it was up to me to come up with analogous screens that would feel at home on *the other OS*.<br/><br/>I was fairly pleased with my efforts, but was honoured to have the app place in Google's [Beautiful Design Winter 2013](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3000235_beautiful_apps) collection. I went on to meet [Nick Butcher](https://twitter.com/crafty) at Devoxx 2014 in Belgium and was stunned by his praise of "You developed The Whole Pantry? That app is beautiful!".</br></br>Working on The Whole Pantry also taught me that doing freelance and full time work simultaneously is no fun at all. I missed having weekends and evenings to myself for a while, but it was an amazing learning experience. I think any freelance work I do from now on will be much smaller in scope!
